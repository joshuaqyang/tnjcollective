She is editor-in-chief of her high school’s newspaper, the <i>Blake Beat</i>, as well as <i>Beck and Call Paper</i>, a collaborative blog developed by alumni of the Yale Young Global Scholars summer program." rel="tooltip">OLIVIA GYAPONG</span></b> &nbsp; SEPT. 18, 2020 <br>
            <b>______</b>
          </p>
          <h3 class="subtitle">Who was Ruth Bader Ginsburg?</h3>
          <p>Supreme Court Justice, firebrand, civil rights champion, longtime feminist and pop culture sensation Ruth Bader Ginsburg <span rel="tooltip" title="The cause of death was complications from metastatic pancreatic cancer.">passed away</span> on Sep. 17 at the age of 87.<sup>1</sup></p>
          <p>Ginsburg voted progressively on issues including abortion rights, same-sex marriage, immigration and health care, according to <i>CNN Politics</i>.<sup>2</sup></p>
          <p>Ginsburg, who was nominated to the Supreme Court in 1993 by former President Bill Clinton, became the second woman appointed to the highest court in the land in its 212-year history.<sup>3</sup></p>
          <p>A lifelong learner, Ginsburg thrived in academia and graduated top of her class at Cornell.<sup>4</sup> Ginsburg attended both Harvard Law School and Columbia Law School, where she graduated at the top of her class from Columbia Law, breaking the proverbial glass ceiling and entering the male-dominated field of law. She also became the first female professor to receive tenure at Columbia University and the first female member of the Harvard Law Review.<sup>5</sup></p>
          <p>Ginsburg garnered national attention for her work with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) in the 1970s, through which she chaired the Women’s Rights Project and wrote briefs on many cases aimed to erase statutes of gender discrimination IBID. Ginsburg would successfully argue in six landmark Supreme Court Cases.<sup>6</sup> The first of her gender discrimination cases—Mortiz v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue—was the case featured in the award-winning 2018 film <i>On the Basis of Sex</i>, which retold salient parts of Ginsburg’s professional and personal life: from inning court cases and not being hired at a law firm because she was a woman to rallying after her husband’s cancer diagnosis.<sup>7</sup></p>


          <br>
          <h3 class="subtitle">What is the process for putting a new justice on the Supreme Court?</h3>
          <p>The president <span rel="tooltip" title="This is usually done after the president has already consulted with senators and knows the nominee is likely to be confirmed">identifies</span> nominees and submits a formal nomination to the Senate Judiciary Committee. There are no constitutional requirements for Supreme Court nominees, but most have a legal background. The Senate then has a hearing to confirm the nominee. If the nominee receives 51 affirmative votes, they are confirmed and appointed to the Supreme Court.<sup>8</sup></p>
          <p>Given that the Republicans currently have a <span rel="tooltip" title="Even if Democrats gain a majority in the Senate through the 2020 elections, this change would not take effect until January 2021.">majority</span> in the Senate, President Trump’s nominee is likely to be confirmed.</p>


          <br>
          <h3 class="subtitle">How soon would Trump be able to put a new person on the Supreme Court?</h3>
          <p>President Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell will try to fill the vacancy before the 2020 election despite Ginsburg’s dying wishes that she not be replaced until after the election;<sup>9</sup> Ginsburg hoped to serve til she was 90 years old.<sup>10</sup></p>
          <p>“[President Trump] can appoint someone as fast as he wants,” AP U.S. Government and Politics teacher <span rel="tooltip" title="Wagner teaches at James Hubert Blake High School in Silver Spring, MD">Mary Wagner</span> said. “He's already shown that he doesn't care about the American Bar Association's recommendation. [Senator Mitch] McConnell will push [the nomination] through as fast as he can. We'll have a new Court by January.”</p>
          <p>According to the Georgetown University Law Library, the Senate Judiciary Committee usually takes a month to collect necessary background information on the nominee and prepare the nominee for hearings.<sup>11</sup></p>
          <p>From nomination to confirmation, the approval process takes around 2.5 months.<sup>12</sup></p>

          <br>
          <h3 class="subtitle">Why is there controversy about Mitch McConnell’s decision to nominate a new justice?</h3>
          <p>Mitch McConnell was already the <span rel="tooltip" title="As Senate Majority Leader, McConnell holds significant sway over the Senate.">Senate Majority Leader</span> in 2016 when a similar situation <span rel="tooltip" title="Justice Antonin Scalia died in March 2016, opening a vacancy.">occurred</span> (during an election year). At the time, McConnell declared that “the American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court Justice. Therefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president.” As such, although President Obama nominated Merrick Garland, Senate Republicans refused to confirm Garland. The vacancy was not filled until President Trump took office and nominated his own candidate.</p>
          <p>Following the death of Ginsburg, however, McConnell vowed to schedule President Trump’s nominee-to-be for a hearing before the end of the year to secure a conservative majority on the Court. According to <i>Fox News</i>,<sup>13</sup> McConnell defended himself against accusations of <span rel="tooltip" title="McConnell and Trump are both Republicans. Obama was a Democrat.">partisanship</span> by citing that  the presidency and Senate were controlled by two different parties in 2016 whereas the presidency and Senate are currently both Republican controlled.</p>

          <br>
          <h3 class="subtitle">What does this mean for each of the political parties? Who will have control over the court?</h3>
          <p>With Ginsburg’s passing, the Supreme Court has become more heavily conservative. There are now five Republican-appointed sitting justices and three Democrat-appointed sitting justices. Upon <span rel="tooltip" title="A likely scenario, especially if Trump wins reelection.">confirmation</span> of President Trump’s nominee, the Court will most likely have a conservative majority of 6-3.<sup>14</sup></p>

          <br>
          <h3 class="subtitle">Who’s the favorite to take the vacated seat?</h3>
          <p>President Trump recently released a list of 20 potential Supreme Court nominees. The most prominent nominees include Senators Tom Cotton (R-AR) and Ted Cruz (R-TX).<sup>15</sup></p>
          <ul>
            <li style="margin: 0.6em 0">Sen. Cotton has been open about his anti-abortion stance and protection of Second Amendment rights.<sup>16</sup></li>
            <li style="margin: 0.6em 0">Daniel Cameron, the current Kentucky Attorney General, is the only Black potential nominee. He is also the youngest candidate at 34 years old.<sup>17</sup></li>
            <li style="margin: 0.6em 0">13 of the 20 potential nominees are younger than <span rel="tooltip" title="Meaning they’d be able to serve for decades.">50 years old</span>.<sup>18</sup></li>
          </ul>
          <p>However, it’s important to note that current justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh—both appointees of President Trump—were not on the shortlist for nomination. Essentially, this means there is a chance that someone not on this list could be nominated and approved.</p>

          <br>
          <h3 class="subtitle">Are there any cases in danger of being overturned?</h3>
          <p>Just a week after the 2020 election, the Supreme Court is scheduled to hear a conservative challenge to Obama’s Affordable Care Act. Chief Justice John Roberts cast the deciding vote to uphold what came to be known as Obamacare in 2012, but with Ginsburg gone and the Court no longer split, the decision may favor Republicans this time.<sup>19</sup></p>
          <p>Wagner also predicted an overturn of abortion policy. “They’ll overturn <span rel="tooltip" title="The Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade protects women’s ability to have an abortion without government control over their reproductive choices.">Roe v. Wade</span> as soon as they can,” she said.</p>

          <br>
          <h3 class="subtitle">What does RBG’s passing mean for the younger generation?</h3>
          <p>Ginsburg was a pop culture icon. Leading up to and after the release of <i>On the Basis of Sex</i>, Ginsburg was referred to as the  “Notorious RBG,” likening her pop culture status to that of rap legend Biggie Smalls. She was the subject of comical operas, documentaries, apparel, <i>Saturday Night Live</i> segments and of course her biopic.<sup>20</sup></p>
